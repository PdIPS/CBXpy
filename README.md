A Python package for consensus-based particle dynamics, focusing on **optimization** and **sampling**. 

# How to use CBXPy?

Minimizing a function using CBXPy can be done as follows:

```python
   from cbx.dynamics import CBO        # import the CBO class

   f = lambda x: x[0]**2 + x[1]**2     # define the function to minimize
   x = CBO(f, d=2).optimize()          # run the optimization
```

A documentation together with more examples and usage instructions is available at [https://pdips.github.io/CBXpy](https://pdips.github.io/CBXpy).


# Installation

Currently ```CBXPy``` can only be installed from PyPI with pip.

```bash
   pip install cbx
```



# What is CBX?

Originally designed for optimization problems of the form

$$
   \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x),
$$

the scheme was introduced as CBO (Consensus-Based Optimization). Given an ensemble of points $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_N)$, the update reads

$$
x_i \gets x_i - \lambda\ dt\ (x_i - c(x)) + \sigma\ \sqrt{dt} |x_i - c(x)|\ \xi_i
$$

where $\xi_i$ are i.i.d. standard normal random vectors. The core element is the consensus point

$$
\begin{align*}
c(x) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\ \exp(-\alpha\ f(x_i))\right)\bigg/\left(\sum_{i=1}^N \exp(-\alpha\ f(x_i))\right)
\end{align*}
$$

with a parameter $\alpha>0$. The scheme can be extended to sampling problems known as CBS, clustering problems and opinion dynamics, which motivates the acronym 
**CBX**, indicating the flexibility of the scheme.
